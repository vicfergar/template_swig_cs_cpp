Template Project using SWIG
=================================
This template shows how to use SWIG to generate the glue code for interfacing between C# and C++ code.

The SWIG command is implemented as a custom build step for the interface file Template.i.
This call generates all the wrapper files (C# and CPP).

An easy script is included to rename projects and dependencies from "Template" to desired target name.
